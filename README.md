## ⚡ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+ 
- **OpenAI API key** (required) - Get one at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- TypeScript or JavaScript project
- Estimated cost: ~$0.01-0.05 per test

### Installation

```bash
# Install from source (npm package coming soon)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/testmind.git
cd testmind
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# 2. Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# 3. Initialize TestMind
testmind init

# 4. Generate a test
testmind generate src/utils/math.ts::add
```

That's it! Your test is generated at `src/utils/math.test.ts`

## ✨ What Makes TestMind Different

### Context-Aware Analysis
- Understands your code's dependencies and side effects
- Detects complexity and suggests appropriate test strategies  
- Identifies boundary conditions automatically

### Smart Test Generation
- Pure functions → simple assertions (no unnecessary mocks)
- Async/IO functions → proper mocking strategies
- Complex functions → comprehensive test coverage

### Performance
- **300x faster than manual testing**
- Small projects: 16ms analysis
- Large projects (100+ files): 356ms analysis
- FileCache optimization: 8.1% additional speedup

## 🚧 Known Limitations (Beta)

- ⚠️ **Requires OpenAI API key** (~$0.01-0.05 per test)
- ⚠️ **TypeScript/JavaScript only** (Python/Java planned for future)
- ⚠️ **Best with pure functions** - Complex stateful code may need manual tuning
- ⚠️ **Beta quality** - Expect some rough edges, we're here to help!
