# Add comprehensive unit tests for debugLog function

## Summary

This PR adds comprehensive unit tests for the `debugLog` function in `observability/dashboard/lib/debug.ts`, bringing test coverage from **0% to 100%**.

## Background

The `debugLog` function is a conditional logging utility controlled by `config.debug`. While it's used throughout the dashboard for development debugging, it currently has no test coverage.

## What's Changed

- ✅ Added `lib/debug.test.ts` with 9 test cases
- ✅ Tests both `config.debug = true` and `false` scenarios
- ✅ Uses vi.mock() for config dependency mocking
- ✅ Uses vi.spyOn() for console.log interception
- ✅ Proper test isolation with beforeEach/afterEach hooks
- ✅ 160 lines of well-documented test code

## Test Coverage

### Scenario 1: config.debug = true (5 tests)
- Logs message with tag only
- Logs message with tag + single argument
- Logs message with tag + multiple arguments
- Logs message with objects/arrays
- Logs message with complex data structures

### Scenario 2: config.debug = false (4 tests)
- Does NOT log when disabled (tag only)
- Does NOT log when disabled (with arguments)
- Does NOT log regardless of argument complexity
- Verifies console.log is never called

## Testing Framework

Uses **Vitest** (matching the project's existing test setup) with:
- `vi.mock()` for dependency mocking
- `vi.spyOn()` for function spying  
- `vi.restoreAllMocks()` for test isolation

## Verification

All tests pass locally:

```bash
pnpm test lib/debug.test.ts
```

```
✓ debugLog (9 tests) 
  ✓ when config.debug is true (5)
  ✓ when config.debug is false (4)

Tests: 9 passed (9 total)
Duration: 18ms
```

## Quality

- ✅ Follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- ✅ Descriptive test names explaining behavior
- ✅ Proper test isolation (no cross-test interference)
- ✅ Clear comments on mocking strategy
- ✅ Fast execution (< 20ms)
- ✅ No external dependencies

## Key Testing Techniques

1. **Config Mocking**: Uses `vi.mock()` to control the debug flag
2. **Console Spying**: Intercepts console.log calls without polluting output
3. **Test Isolation**: Restores all mocks after each test
4. **Scenario Testing**: Groups related tests by config state

## Notes for Reviewers

- This test uses `vi.mock()` to override `config.debug` value
- `console.log` is spied on but implementation is mocked to keep test output clean
- All mocks are properly restored after each test
- Tests are independent and can run in any order
