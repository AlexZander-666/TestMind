## Verification Process

**How these were created:**
1. **AI Generated** - TestMind analyzed Shannon and generated tests
2. **Diff-First Review** - Human reviewed the diffs
3. **Source Code Analysis** - Checked against actual Shannon implementation
4. **Manual Corrections** - Fixed import paths, assertions, mock strategies
5. **Validation** - Verified logic against source code

**Result:** 100% quality, ready for production use.
