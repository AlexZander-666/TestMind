## ⚠️ Important Notice

These tests are **AI-generated** and have NOT been verified to run correctly.

**Known Issues:**
- Import paths may be incorrect (e.g., `../lib/format` vs `./format`)
- Test expectations may need adjustment
- Mock strategies may need refinement

**Recommendation:** Use tests from `../verified-tests/` instead - these have been manually verified and are 100% correct.
